Packages Used for Geolocation :
Geolocator 9.0.1
Package for Geofence :
Geofence 0.4.4

Approach :
I have started with a very basic application where the user clicks on a button and gets his current location. 
This was to get an overview of the geolocation library and its use cases.
Further I will use function from both the geolocator and geofence packages to implement the kind of geofencing required for our application.
